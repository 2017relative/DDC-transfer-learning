# DDC-transfer-learning
A simple implementation of Deep Domain Confusion: Maximizing for Domain Invariance. 
The project contains *Pytorch* code for fine-tuning *Alexnet* as well as *DDCnet*  implemented according to the original paper which adds an adaptation layer into the Alexnet. 
The *office31* dataset used in the paper is also used in this implementation to test the performance of fine-tuning *Alexnet* and *DDCnet* with additional linear *MMD* loss. Whatâ€™s more, 

# Run the work
* Run command `python alextnet_finetune.py` to fine-tune a pretrained *Alexnet* on *office31* dataset with *full-training*.
* Run command `python DDC.py` to fine-tune a pretrained *Alexnet* on *office31* dataset with *full-training*.

# Future work
- [ ] Write data loader using  *down-sample* protocol mentioned in the paper instead of using *full-training* protocol.
- [ ] Considering trying a tensorflow version to see if frameworks can have a difference on final experiment results.
